            Hey, it's a start! As the size of the viewport changes, the content is resized to display appropriately. Web browsers are already responsive by default, but as you add more and more complex components it takes extra effort to preserve that property. What more could you ask for? Buttons, widgets, columns, navigation, images, pretty styling? We will get there.

             Keep at the end of the body so it doesn't delay initial display of the page -->
